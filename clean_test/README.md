In this folder, the tracks from the ``wavfiles_ToPredict`` folder will be saved when runing the ```predict.py``` file.
In this ```predict.py``` file, the sample rate of the tracks is reduced before making predictions in order to make the
prediction faster andi nthe same way than in the training.
Before runing ```predict.py```, remove this readme file from this folder (```clean_test```).
