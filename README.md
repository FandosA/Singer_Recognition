# Singer Recognition using Deep Learning

In this project, I implemented a dense neural network, a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network for singer recognition. The 4 singers with whom I trained the networks were Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden), Freddie Mercury (Queen), James Hetfield (Metallica) and Michael Jackson. This project was my final bachelor's degree thesis, which can be found and read [here](https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/96551/files/TAZ-TFG-2020-2198.pdf)  (spanish).

## Implementation

The file ``cfg.py`` contains the features to preprocess the audio before training the model, as well as the folders in which those models and the pickles will be saved once the model is trained.
